    <p>My Name is Sam Minor and I'm a Data Engineer at Versant Power. I'm also a recent graduate of the University of Maine at Orono. There, I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science and began my development journey. During my time at the University of Maine, I found a love for computer science and throughout my short tenure at Versant, my passion for web development has only grown. I really enjoy creating projects and helping out others wherever I can. Whether or not that's through my work, projects, or simple everyday things. If you want to learn more about me, you can always reach out through my links posted under contact!</p>
